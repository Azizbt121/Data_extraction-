# Data Extraction Methods in Python

This repository demonstrates various Python techniques for data extraction. The methods covered include the use of the `requests` library, `urllib.request.urlretrieve`, and `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4`, providing efficient ways to retrieve data from multiple sources such as websites, APIs, and downloadable files.

## Methods Included

### 1. **Using `requests` Library**
The `requests` library is a simple and intuitive tool for making HTTP requests. It is commonly used to fetch raw content, such as HTML or JSON data, from a URL. This method is suitable for working with APIs or retrieving data directly from web pages.

### 2. **Using `urllib.request.urlretrieve`**
`urllib.request.urlretrieve` allows you to download files directly from a URL and save them to your local machine. It is often used for downloading files like images, PDFs, or large datasets.

### 3. **Using `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4`**
`BeautifulSoup` is a library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It is frequently used in web scraping to extract specific data from websites by navigating the HTML structure. You can use `BeautifulSoup` to easily find elements like links, tables, images, and more.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a resource for learning and experimenting with different data extraction methods in Python. Whether you need to scrape websites, download files, or interact with APIs, the methods demonstrated here can help streamline the data collection process for your projects.

## Installation

To use these methods, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- `requests`
